# RFinalProject
This repository contains the code for the final project in my R programing class. The project uses a Stroke dataset obtained from a lecture resource on the Udemy learning platform. The dataset includes major factors related to whether a patient has a stroke or not, such as hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI (Body Mass Index), and age. The main objective of this project is to analyze the stroke dataset, perform data cleaning and wrangling, visualize the data, and conduct data analysis. The project includes various R code snippets that demonstrate different data manipulation and visualization techniques.
